C++ program for college computer architecture course aimed to compare efficency of Intel x86-64 architecture with ARM. We implemented some alghorithms (Pi next number calculation and Fibbonacci next number calculation), measured time and memory. In order to make our resource more reliable we launched program on minimal Arch Linux.<br/>
